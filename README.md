A robber has attacked a bank in New York, armed with a bunch of flowers and a note reading “Don’t be a hero”.
The thief approached the cashier’s window in the United States with a large bouquet of flowers and handing over a hold-up note.
Police told The New York Post they were examining a large bunch of blooms – yellow chrysanthemums, orange and red daisies, and gladioli buds, among others flowers – used by the man in the robbery last week.
A security camera photo published by the police showed the suspect standing at the cashier’s window holding the bouquet while handing over the note, which reportedly read: “Give me all your hundreds, fifties, don’t be a hero.”
The man fled the scene after the teller handed over $440 (£288).
The New York Post reported that it was the second known bank heist by the suspect, who last week robbed a different New York bank armed with a potted houseplant.
